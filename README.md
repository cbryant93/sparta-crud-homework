# sparta-crud-homework
Your homework this weekend is to combine everything you're learned this week and create a well designed full-stack website with two resources. Pull requests by 9am Monday morning latest. The Repo name will be sparta-sinatra-fullstack  The project must have:  - two or more resources (a new Database with two tables) - an MVC structure - a local seed file (you can have more than 1 SQL table command in one seed.sql file) - full CRUD functionality (with seperate MVC for each) - a Static directory with at least 1 page correctly linked (eg. landing, FAQ, T&amp;Cs) - Styled with Bootstrap - A README explaining how to clone the repo, seed the data  Bonus Points  - Linking the resources and displaying the data - added Javascript (entirely up to you - be creative) - linking to an external API (Google Maps or TFL Bikes are good ones)  Useful Links  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) - [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) - [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
